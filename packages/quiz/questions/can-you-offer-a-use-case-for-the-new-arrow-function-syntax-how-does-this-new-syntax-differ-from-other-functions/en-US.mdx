title: Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax?
subtitle: How does this new syntax differ from other functions?
---

The `=>` function syntax, also known as "arrow functions," is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) for JavaScript. It provides a more concise way to write functions and also has some differences in how `this` behaves compared to traditional function expressions. Here's a simple use case to illustrate its utility:

## Use case: filtering an array

Imagine you have an array of numbers, and you want to filter out all the numbers that are less than 10. Using traditional function syntax and the new arrow function syntax, you can achieve this in the following ways:

### Traditional functions syntax

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20];
const filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(function (number) {
  return number >= 10;
});

console.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [10, 15, 20]
```

### Arrow function syntax

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20];
const filteredNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number >= 10);

console.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [10, 15, 20]
```

## Advantages of arrow functions

1. **Conciseness**: Arrow functions are more concise, making your code shorter and easier to read.
1. **`this` Behavior**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope at the time they are defined. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you are dealing with callbacks and want to retain the context of `this`.
1. **Implicit Return**: If the function body consists of a single expression, arrow functions allow you to omit the `return` keyword and the curly braces.

## When to use arrow functions

- When you need a quick, one-line function.
- In callback functions where you want to preserve the lexical scope of `this`.
- When working with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.

## When not to use arrow functions

- **Methods in objects**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context, which can lead to unexpected behavior in object methods.
- **As constructors**: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error if used with the `new` keyword.
- **When you need to use function hoisting**: Arrow functions are not hoisted, unlike traditional function declarations.

Arrow functions are a powerful addition to JavaScript, simplifying function syntax and addressing some common pitfalls associated with the `this` keyword in traditional functions. They are especially useful in modern JavaScript development patterns.
